# Video Frame Extraction

This repository contains a Python script that extracts frames from a video file and saves them as JPG images. This is useful for analyzing video content or preprocessing frames.

## Features

- **Extract Frames**: The script reads a video file and extracts each frame, saving it as a separate JPEG image.
- **Output Folder**: Automatically creates a folder to store the extracted frames if it doesn't already exist.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
